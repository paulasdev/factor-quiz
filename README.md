## Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was based on the background image - A newspaper. I wanted to keep the colour scheme that best matched the background image and kept it simple for users to see.

### Typography
Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.
For the page title I have used the google font Rampart One.
For the body of the page I have used the google font Rubik.
