## Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was based on the background image - A newspaper. I wanted to keep the colour scheme that best matched the background image and kept it simple for users to see.

### Typography
Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.
For the page title I have used the google font Rampart One.
For the body of the page I have used the google font Rubik.

### Imagery
The newspaper as the image used as the background image was based on "getting" knowledge on different subjects.

### Site Structure
The header is at the top of the two sections.
 
![title](assets/images/title.png)

On the home page there are 4 buttons with different categories: movies, animals, cars and sports, which is the access to start the game, where the user must choose one of the categories that he wants to test his knowledge.

In the second section under the header there is a score with " / " (slash) to indicate on the left side the number of correct answers and on the right side the number of questions.

![scores](assets/images/scores.png)

The quiz area is divided into questions and answers according to the category the user has chosen

![quiz](assets/images/questionarea.png.png)

The user is informed in case of no selected answer.

When the user completes the 10 questions answered, their score is displayed on the screen and the play again! button is enabled.
